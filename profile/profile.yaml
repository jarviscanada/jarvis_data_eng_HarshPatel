      - "Grep App:  Implemented a JavaGrep interface to perform functions the same as the grep command in Linux. The program was written with the help of IntelliJ and searched patterns recursively in a given directory that stores the matched lines to an output file. Stream and lambda expressions were used for the efficient search through the directories and files. slf4j was used for logging messages. The Java grep app was packaged using Maven and dockerized to consume it easily.."
